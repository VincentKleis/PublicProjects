| 3.10    | :white_check_mark: |

### rust

I use the moste up to date version of rust, but most of my code uses basic rust functionality that is probably compatible with older versions
send me a mail with rust in the title to vintok999@gmail.com if you have compatibility issues, include the specifics of the problem and your rust version.

### HTML, CSS
I use firefox 119.0 at the time of writing, so if there are compatibility issues then send me a mail to vintok999@gmail.com
