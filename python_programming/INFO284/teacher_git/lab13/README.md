### Lab 13 Reinforcement learning with Deep Q Learning on Pytorch
In this lab exercise we will take a look at Deep Q learning with neural networks on a rather simple task of cartpole-v0 from OpenAI Gym. We didnt cover Deep Q Learning but it is basically estimatating the Q* function which maps State - Actions to Rewards using netural networks. The tutorial is from [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html). But it is also available in the folder of this lab. Please upload it to your google collab to try it out.

To learn the concept of Deep Q Learning this is a [good tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/qrash-course-deep-q-networks-from-the-ground-up-1bbda41d3677).
