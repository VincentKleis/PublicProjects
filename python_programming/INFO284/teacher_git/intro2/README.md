# Part 2 - Introduction to Python for Machine Learning

Goals of this lab

1. Learn about Jupyter Notebook for iPython covering basic components of a notebook and how does it work.
2. Basic usage of Numpy, Scipy, Pands and matloblib libraries from the main textbooks first Notebook. Modify and test out the whole notebook 01-introduction.ipynb
3. Reading and writing files. Attempt to write some of the arrays or texts to files and read them again.
