"timeline initiation" is a script ment to initiate the datastructure for oure purpose in MySQL,
but first you wil need to install the needed connectors and the server it self, to do this i made a few guides in the git wiki section.

the file in "historium_register" named "historium_classes" is a start to how to make a logg_in function and a register function.
the register function is halfway compleeted, it has the needed python functionality to create the values a profile need, but is not able
to send them to the SQL database. so something goes wrong when trying to send the variables as strings to the MySQl database. 
in MySQL workbench the same problem presents it self if you do not properly enclose your data in quotationmarks ('') so i think the variables are sent from python without quotationmarks.
